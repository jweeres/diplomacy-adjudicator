Diplomacy Adjudicator
=====================

# Introduction

The goal of this repository is to create a [DATC-compliant](http://web.inter.nl.net/users/L.B.Kruijswijk/#2) adjudicator in python.

The primary purpose of the adjudicator is to be incorporated in [this online diplomacy project](https://github.com/Blensink/Diplomacy), though the hope is that it will be general enough to be used in other projects as well.

In accordance with DATC, the this project uses the [2000 rulebook](http://www.diplom.org/~diparch/resources/rulebooks/2000AH4th.pdf) as the base set of rules.

The [Diplomacy Adjudicator Test Cases](http://web.inter.nl.net/users/L.B.Kruijswijk/) are invaluable.

The goal is to implement [this algorithm](http://www.diplom.org/Zine/S2009M/Kruijswijk/DipMath_Chp1.htm) in python and have it pass all test cases.
